Hello there! This repository, **praiseprince.github.me**, is the home of my [personal portfolio website](https://praiseprince.me). Here, you'll find all the HTML and CSS code that powers my portfolio, along with the assets (images, files, etc.) I've used to create a visually appealing and informative online presence.

Feel free to explore the code and assets to learn more about how I've designed and developed my portfolio. If you're curious about specific aspects of my website, the following sections will guide you through the contents of this repository.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html`: This HTML file is the main entry point to my portfolio website. It defines the structure of the webpage, including sections like About Me, Projects, Contact, etc. It also links to the CSS file for styling.

- `style.css`: The CSS file contains all the styling rules that dictate how the content on my portfolio website is presented. From colors and fonts to layout and responsiveness, this file controls the visual aspects of the site.

- `assets/`: This directory contains all the images, files, icons, and any other resources I've used in my portfolio. Keeping them organized here makes it easy to manage and reference them in the HTML and CSS code.
